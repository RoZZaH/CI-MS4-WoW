      "description": "Australia had a hard year in 2020 battling persistent and traumatic wildfires, so it’s particularly gratifying to celebrate one of its natural, national treasures. With a taste of the Shiraz at Penfolds’ recorking clinic in Los Angeles last fall, it was love at first sip. Actually, at first scent. Heady with aromas of forest floor, coffee, black licorice and an unusual explosion of violets, the wine was transfixing. And it tastes even better than it smells. The vibrant dark-berry and subtle spice notes seduce, penetrating through layers of minerals and acid, and there’s impressive balance between the fruit and integrated, supple tannins. While Shiraz grapes are the star (at 98 percent), winemaker Peter Gago adds a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon from one of Penfolds’ most precious plots, Block 42 of the Kalimna Vineyard, which nurtures what are thought to be the oldest continuously producing Cabernet vines in the world, planted in the 1880s. The 2015 harvest was warm and fast, resulting in beautiful fruit. Gago aged the wine for 20 months in new American oak hogshead barrels before bottling it for the cellars. The 2015 is delicious now—“At once lively and expressive, yet still not revealing all,” says Gago—but will be even more impressive in 10 years. It’s a shining example of Grange.",

Within the region lie the vineyards of the esteemed Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, affectionately abbreviated as the DRC. Its older vintages set records at auction; its newest ones sell out. Its eight Grand Crus are planted to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, making what some consider the highest expression of both varietals. Among them, the Romanée-Conti and La Tâche parcels usually emerge as the crown princes. But in this year’s tasting, Romanée-St-Vivant stood out as the most balanced, layered and complex of the 2017 vintage. The year’s harvest was an abundant one, successfully fending off the frosts of 2016, and the Burgundian vignerons were especially pleased with the high quality of the berries. The wines from this vintage are still young compared to their potential maturity, but already the Romanée-St-Vivant stands out as evocative. Perfume blooms from the glass. It’s elegant, graceful yet powerful, its fruit underlined with a lush earthiness and crushed-rock minerality that lead to a long, strong finish. Winemaker Aubert de Villaine calls it right, saying, “Romanée-St-Vivant is flirtatious. One cannot help loving it.”",

His 2016 Cardinale Cabernet captures the ultimate potential offered by that remarkable year: a hedonistic wine of the moment with great aging possibility at the same time. Dark and concentrated, it unfolds with spicy anise, briary blackberry and fresh herbs over a crushed- rock character. It’s satisfyingly juicy, with loads of dark cherry, plum and cassis spiked with delicious mocha. But delicious as it is right now, Carpenter says, “it will be one of those vintages that continues to develop in positive ways for years to come. Like Michael Jordan when he played at North Carolina—back then you could just tell there was so much more to come. I feel that way looking at these early-release years of the 2016 Cardinale and where this wine will be 10 to 20 years from now.”",

Masseto—sister flagship brand to the Frescobaldi’s Ornellaia—also opened a stunning new subterranean winery, excavated from underneath the same vineyard that produces the wine. “Every great institution has a house,” says group president Lamberto Frescobaldi. “The White House, St. Peter’s. . . .

Dark-berry and plum flavors are laced with baking spices (anise and clove), and its fine tannins are delivered with an ideal tension of acidity and freshness. After more than 20 years tending vines in Sonoma, the duo has many of what they call “micro-crus” from which to handpick for their blend. In 2016, they were so pleased with the Cab Franc that they increased the amount in the blend to 82 percent (with the remainder being Merlot and Malbec), which allowed them, in their words, to “lift the gravity center of the wine.” The result is a heady, magical wine you want to smell as much as sip.",

Its bay proximity ensures that the property is swept by ocean breezes, adding cool-weather balance to its wines. John declines to interfere much during the winemaking, even going low on new wood (only about 40 percent). The combination of site and minimal winemaking in this stunning 2017 Syrah gives it expansive aromatics, including the savory, gamy elements Kongsgaard embraces: wild blueberry, smoked meat, florals and black pepper.

A recent, outstanding vertical tasting of the Private Reserve, going back to the 1960s, offered convincing evidence of the wine’s bright balance through the decades.

Of the two wines, the Sage Ridge wine spoke loudest (in the best way possible) to us, with a wintery herbaceousness.

In contrast, Mod Sélection uses the direct maceration of Pinot Noir grapes. Founder Brent Hocking says, “This creates substantially more aromatic components, which I love. This method of vinification is more demanding and requires perfectly ripe grapes and exacting timing. This is the true rosé.” And the proof is in the glass. For a wine that was 12 years old upon release, this deep-salmon-hued fizz is surprisingly vibrant and fresh, but also refined. It’s made of 50 percent Pinot Meunier, 40 percent Chardonnay and just 10 percent Pinot Noir. Bright raspberry and cherry come to the fore, with ginger and spice notes following on the palate.

And with the vineyards in question running from the crest of the hill to the bottom, Bonneau du Martray is able to blend bright fruit from the top, full of energy and verve, with richer, fatter grapes from the lower sites to create an exquisitely balanced Chardonnay—arguably the most complete expression of this famous place. The Bonneau du Martray 2016 is bright and energetic. A signature lemon-curd character and chiseled backbone meet with a perfect balance among fruit and savory notes, tension and, above all, texture.",

But the brand also does something unique with each vintage: It releases the wine in two stages, initially about eight years after going into bottle, then again after another eight years, in what Dom Pérignon calls its second plenitude, or P2. The portion held back remains on the lees to accumulate even more complexity. The 2002 P2 ($390) surpasses the 2000 and 1998 versions and is much more complex than the first-vintage 2002. The P2 is light, ethereal, with just 4 grams of dosage added. This is a cascade of creamy, nutty elegance, with refreshing fruit on the palate. It’s still vivid and energized, even 17 years post-harvest. The 2002 P2 marks the first release under new chef de cave Vincent Chaperon, who has been turning the brand toward biodynamic and organic farming practices. “Dom Pérignon is embracing the completeness of wine,” he says, adding that while most winemakers have been making Champagne too technical, Dom Pérignon “is embracing technology, but also tradition and wine’s social and emotional link—wine helps us to go on dreaming.” The 2002 P2 certainly drinks like a dream.",

Winemaker Virginia Willcock makes the most of the area’s Mediterranean-like climate on an estate where the region’s first commercial vines were planted, in 1967—Vasse Felix. The 2016 Chardonnay ($45) smells of lemon pie crust and tropical pineapple, with a taste of buttery croissant and nougat on the palate. But it has enough acid to keep it vibrant and zingy. The wine spends nine months on the lees in French oak that’s a mix of old and new. Willcock is a passionate proponent of the use of wild, native yeasts in Australian winemaking, and this wine benefits from that innovation, as well as from hand-harvesting and a gentle, whole-cluster press.",

On the natural wine front, then, Tillingham is arguably top of the pile, thanks to a combination of traditional production, creative branding and compelling storytelling. The Tillingham estate, headed by Ben Walgate (see main pic, above), is set amongst 70 acres of stately East Sussex countryside – a mixed farm dating from the 13th century, with rooms available for overnight guests and a smashing restaurant. “It’s perhaps more an energy than a flavour that makes a wine identifiable as Tillingham,” Walgate says. For his Qvevri White, he transplanted Georgian technique to our less temperate isle. The result is a subtle wine with bright acidity, powerful aromatics and plenty of texture.",

The soil in which her vines grow is idiosyncratically calcareous (hence the name), lending itself to wines with robust minerality. The Bianco, in a neat litre bottle, is Puglia writ large – sharp with lemon, ripe with orange and apricot, and the colour of a summer day’s first light. “I’ve discovered a new awareness for nature and my winery’s mission,” says Passalacqua, reflecting on her own recent time in lockdown. “It’s about peaceful living, which is why those words will be added to our upcoming bottles as a fresh creed, along with new, inspiration-led illustrations. Natural wine, for me, is just a first step towards a deeper understanding of, and connection to, nature.”",

The exact proportions of each variety used varies by region, winemaker and style. Cabernet Sauvignon typically provides the blend's structure, in terms of both tannins and acids. It also brings dark-fruit flavors of blackcurrant and bell pepper. Merlot is generally considered the juicer, \"fatter\" variety; it has less structure, but is generous with its palate weight and fruit flavors. This is visibly reflected in the vineyard, by Merlot's larger, plumper berries, whose thinner skins give a lower skin to juice ratio. Cabernet's robust structure is fattened out with Merlot's juicy fruit – a marriage with excellent long-term potential when assembled with care.",

      "description": "Viña Errazuriz is a Chilean wine estate founded in the Aconcagua Valley in 1870 by Don Maximiano Errazuriz, who travelled on horseback out beyond established vineyard areas near Santiago to find the best possible terroir. By the time of the first release in 1873, the estate had over 300 hectares (740 acres) of vineyards. By 1890 this figure had risen to 700 hectares (1730 acres), making Errazuriz the largest wine estate in the world owned by an individual.",
